# SMUTimeTableBot
TelegramBot Project for SMU students to view their Time Table straight via Telegram instead of having to log into SMU platforms.

Bot has an added feature for SMU students to find common timeslots in their timetable within a chat group to ease scheduling for projects.

Sample Timetable File is included in the repository for viewers to check out the bot.
